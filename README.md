# Evelyn Fan website

Fan-made SPA (Single Page Application) Website for [Evelyn](https://youtube.com/c/HaiHaloEpel). Created with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) + [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) + [SASS](https://sass-lang.com). Now it's heavily maintained at Development Production.

## Project philosophy

The beginning of this project was made to introduce [Evelyn](https://youtube.com/c/HaiHaloEpel) to a larger audience with a website. It was also made for tribute purposes. Besides the formal reason, another reason is that the project owner simps her. And he has a passion to build and develop this project.
